## PacBio (HiFi)

### Runtime

Runtime is on HG003 (all chromosomes).

Stage                            | Time (minutes)
-------------------------------- | -----------------
make_examples                    | ~173m

### Accuracy

hap.py results on HG003 (all chromosomes, using NIST v4.2.1 truth), which was
held out while training.

(The input BAM is phased already and DeepVariant was run with
`--use_hp_information=true`.)

## Hybrid (Illumina + PacBio HiFi)

### Runtime

Runtime is on HG003 (all chromosomes).

Stage                            | Time (minutes)
-------------------------------- | -----------------
make_examples                    | ~162m

total                            | ~380m = ~6.33 hours

### Accuracy

Evaluating on HG003 (all chromosomes, using NIST v4.2.1 truth), which was held
out while training the hybrid model.

| Type  | TRUTH.TP | TRUTH.FN | QUERY.FP | METRIC.Recall | METRIC.Precision | METRIC.F1_Score |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| INDEL | 503355   | 1146     | 1939     | 0.997728      | 0.996346         | 0.997037        |
| SNP   | 3323945  | 3551     | 1581     | 0.998933      | 0.999525         | 0.999229        |

## How to reproduce the metrics on this page

For simplicity and consistency, we report runtime with a
[CPU instance with 64 CPUs](deepvariant-details.md#command-for-a-cpu-only-machine-on-google-cloud-platform)
This is NOT the fastest or cheapest configuration.

Use `gcloud compute ssh` to log in to the newly created instance.

Download and run any of the following case study scripts:

```
# Get the script.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/deepvariant/r1.3/scripts/inference_deepvariant.sh

# WGS
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WGS

# WES
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset WES

# PacBio
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset PACBIO

# Hybrid
bash inference_deepvariant.sh --model_preset HYBRID_PACBIO_ILLUMINA
```

Runtime metrics are taken from the resulting log after each stage of
DeepVariant. The runtime numbers reported above are the average of 5 runs each.
The accuracy metrics come from the hap.py summary.csv output file.
The runs are deterministic so all 5 runs produced the same output.
